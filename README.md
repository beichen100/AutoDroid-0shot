# AutoDroid-0shot

## About

AutoDroid-0shot is a GPT-powered GUI task automator for Android.
It can control a smartphone app automatically based on a natural language task description.
It is built upon [DroidBot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot) with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)-style APIs.

This repo is a naive baseline for mobile task automation that does not require any customization for the apps. It simply send the task and state to GPT and ask for the next action to perform.
A more advanced version (with app-specific memory injection and other optimizations) can be found at [AutoDroid](https://github.com/MobileLLM/AutoDroid).

## How to use

1. Prepare:

    + An app to use. Download the `.apk` file to your host machine.
    + A device or an emulator connected to your host machine via `adb`.
    + Modify how to query your LLM (with your own API or key) at [here](https://github.com/MobileLLM/DroidBot-GPT/blob/09c0d5d380c508f244321e236edb5697c59983e3/droidbot/input_policy.py#L740C6-L740C6)

2. Start AutoDroid-0shot:

    ```
    droidbot -a <path_to_apk> -o output_dir -task <your_task>
    ```
    That's it! The options are mostly the same as [DroidBot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot) except for the new `-task` option, where you can specify any task you want to complete. For example,

    - Create a contact named Alice with phone number 1234567.
    - Book a table for 4 people on Saterday.
    - Send a message to Sam to have a chat tonight.
    - ...
